### About My Project
The included  project represents a new Unity project where the following have been done:
- All assets needed to complete the project according to the project rubric have been imported.
- The imported models have been placed in the scene and organized in the scene hierarchy.
- Colliders have been added to the `Coin`, `Key`, `Left_Door`, `Right_Door`, and `The_Temple` game objects, and to the `Maze` game object's child game objects.

### Instructions
To complete the maze you must first find all 5 coins scattered throughout to reveal the key. Only once you have collected the key can you open the door to the temple. If you need help finding the coins or the key, find your way to the pedestals and look out from them to get view of the maze.
